# Flight-Fare-Prediction

# Description

- The project deals with predicting flight fares by using different machine learning models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision tree, Gradient Boosting, Extra trees and Ridge regression 
- Deploying the best model as an API using FastAPI. 
- At the end of the training and testing phase, it was found that Random Forest had the highest R2 score among the machine learning models

# Code

- The entire can be be tested using the **Project2 Code.ipynb** file 

# For credit card default prediction

- Make sure to download the pickled file: **BestModel.pkl** and then run **fare_app.ipynb** and proceed to the API for prediction

# Deployment files

- BestModel.pkl
- fare_app.ipynb
